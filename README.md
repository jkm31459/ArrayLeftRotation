# ArrayLeftRotation

Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform  left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of integers) and  (the number of left rotations you must perform). 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

### Constraints
1 <= d <= n

### Output Format

Print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

### Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5

### Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
